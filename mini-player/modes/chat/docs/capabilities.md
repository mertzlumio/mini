## Core Functions

### File Reading
- Read configuration files, documentation, and capability files
- List available files in allowed directories
- Useful for self-discovery and understanding context

### Web Search  
- Search for current information using DuckDuckGo
- Get real-time results with titles, snippets, and URLs
- Ideal for recent events, news, schedules

### Task Management
- Add items to user's notes/todo list
- Help users remember tasks and organize information
- Integrate with local notes file system

## Usage Patterns

When a user asks about current events → Use web search
When a user wants to remember something → Use task management  
When unsure about capabilities → Use file reading to explore

## Self-Discovery

- modes/chat/capabilities/ (implementation files)
- modes/chat/prompts/ (prompt configurations)
